## 📝 Description (Copy This)

```
LogerClaw is an autonomous AI agent that optimizes end-to-end logistics routes for domestic and cross-border shipments. It combines intelligent multi-factor route optimization with immutable blockchain verification on Solana.

The agent analyzes multiple route options considering cost, time, safety, and customs complexity, then provides a recommended route with comprehensive cost breakdown, risk assessment, and natural language reasoning. Every routing decision is anchored to Solana blockchain for cryptographic verification and immutable audit trail.

Key Features:
- AI-powered route optimization with 5 specialized tools
- Multi-factor analysis (cost, time, safety, risk)
- Real-time GPS-tracked event simulation
- Production-ready REST API (7 endpoints)
- Immutable blockchain anchoring via Solana
- Natural language explanations for decisions

Built with TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and Solana (AgentWallet). Fully deployed and accessible via public API.

## ⛓️ Solana Integration (Copy This)

```
LogerClaw uses Solana for immutable on-chain anchoring of every routing decision via AgentWallet. When the AI agent makes a route recommendation, the decision is cryptographically verified and stored on Solana blockchain as a self-transfer transaction (1 lamport minimal cost).

Technical Implementation:
- AgentWallet API for wallet management and transaction signing
- Self-transfer transactions to anchor decisions on-chain
- Transaction signatures stored with each route decision
- Solana Explorer links for public verification

Use Cases Enabled:
- Audit Trail: Immutable history of all routing decisions
- Dispute Resolution: Cryptographic proof that cannot be altered
- Supply Chain Financing: On-chain verification for financing partners
- Multi-Party Trust: No intermediaries needed, blockchain provides trust
- Regulatory Compliance: Transparent, verifiable decision records

Every decision includes a Solana transaction signature and Explorer link, making it publicly verifiable and tamper-proof. This creates trust in AI decisions for critical supply chain operations.
